# Evolving Definitions: Analyzing the Granularity of SME Classifications in Japan
This study examines the increasing granularity of SME classifications in Japan by analyzing parliamentary discussions during the enactment of three key laws: *the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Basic Act* (1963), *the Basic Act on Small Enterprise Promotion* (2014), and *the Revised Industrial Competitiveness Enhancement Act* (2024). Using text analysis methods such as Word Cloud, TF-IDF, keyword frequency, and topic modeling, it reveals that the 1963 Act focused on establishing foundational SME policies, the 2014 Act targeted regional revitalization through micro-enterprise support, and the 2024 Act emphasized investment and growth in medium-sized companies. These shifts reflect evolving economic priorities, from foundational support to regional development and national economic growth. Contrary to initial hypotheses, historical contexts like the Heisei recession or inflation were not central in deliberations, which instead focused on the laws' objectives. Limitations include reliance on Diet records; future studies could integrate public opinion analysis for deeper insights.
